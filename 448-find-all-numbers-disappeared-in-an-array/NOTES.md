Approach1:
create set of numbers from arr
iterate range from 1 to n
if num is missing in set then keep in res arr
​
TC - O(N) + O(N)
SC - O(N)
​
Approach2:
As the numbers are in range 1 ro n
we can use of index in arr
lets create a new index from value and update the value to -1
​
iterate from 1 to n and check which index has positive value in arr
​
TC- O(N) + O(N)
SC - O(1)
